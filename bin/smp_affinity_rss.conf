# RSS indir table size used by ethtool --set-rxfh-indir 'equal' parameter.
#
# From man ethtool(8):
#  --set-rxfh-indir equal N
#
#    Sets the receive flow hash indirection table to spread flows evenly between
#    the first N receive queues.
#
# In effect this limit how many RX-queues are active.
#
# For the use-case of xdp-cpumap-tc, that scale the Linux network-stack by
# load-balancing across multiple TX-queues, it is desired to have less RX-queues
# than TX-queues.
#
# First of all XDP RX-work takes less time, but second objective is to increase
# chances of bulk RX processing.  Each RX-queue can bulk up-to 64 packets, but
# when too many RX-queues are configured packets will be distributed too thin
# across RX-queues.
#
# Most NICs have "combined" RX+TX queues (ethtool --show-channels). Thus,
# reducing RX-queues also result in reduced TX-queues.  Adjusting RSS indirect
# table to only use the first N RX-queues, allows for more TX-queues to
# load-balance across.
